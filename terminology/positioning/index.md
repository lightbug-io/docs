# Positioning

Lightbug devices make use of a combination of technologies to determine their location.

The most common of these are GNSS (commonly referred to as GPS), but we also use other technologies to fill in the gaps when a GPS lock may not be found due to device configuration.

The most precise locations come from RTK enabled devices, which can provide centimeter level accuracy, such as the [RH2](/devices/rtk/handheld/) and [VTRTK](/devices/rtk/vehicle).
