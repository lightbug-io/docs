# Devices

All of our devices are designed and made in the UK from the same modular components.

## Core

Our core products have been rigorously tested in the field since and iterated on since 2015, are used by customers around the world, and are available to purchase from stock, via a [sales enquiry](https://lightbug.io/contact/)
