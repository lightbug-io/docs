# Base URLs

Both APIs are accessible using the base URL `https://api.lightbug.cloud`.

The [version 1](/apis/v1/) API, accessible at `/api`, has been around since the first days of Lightbug. This API is stable and is used by the current platform, exposing all the functionality that is available to users.

The [version 2](/apis/v2/) API, accessible at `/v2`, is our new REST API (since 2023) that will see new interfaces to existing functionality, and new functionality being added.
