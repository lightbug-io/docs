# Activate device on reseller plan

:::danger ⚠️ API Removed
This API has been removed as there is no longer a concept of "Reseller Plans" in the system.

You can see what plan is currently active on a device by using the [`GET /devices/{id}/plan` endpoint.](/apis/v2/get-devices-id-plan)

You can modify that plan with the [`PUT /devices/{id}/plan` endpoint](apis/v2/put-devices-id-plan).

There are various over v2 endpoints for interacting with these plans.
