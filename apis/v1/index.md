# Version 1: [/api](https://api.lightbug.cloud/api)

Accessible via: https://api.lightbug.cloud/api

The first version of the API, which is still called by most Lightbug UI applications.

This API is very much tied to low level representations of data.

As V2 is developed, a higher level set of interactions will be introduced.
