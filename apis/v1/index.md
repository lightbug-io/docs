# Version 1

The version 1 API provides the most feature complete experience for interacting with the data in the Lightbug cloud.

The API data representation is very close to underlying data storage models, and some of the interactions are quite low level (such as granular bitfield device configurations).

For a more modern, higher level experience, we recommend the [V2 API](./../v2/), where endpoints allow.
