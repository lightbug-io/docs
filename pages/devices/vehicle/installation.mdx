## Finding the fuse box

Every vehicle has a fuse box. Here are a few steps on how to find the fuse box inside the car.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Fuses are very important because without them several electronic devices, such as the electric windows, the power locks, the lights and radio would not work.
</Callout>

The below pictorial representation shows only one particular scenario, but they may vary from car to car.

        2. Compartment fuse box
    </CardBody>
</Card>

<Steps>

### Step 1: Check the manual

Check your vehicle owner’s manual and familiarize yourself with the location of the fuse boxs.

One is usually under your dashboard, to the side of your steering wheel and the other one is normally located under the hood of the car.

### Step 2: Primary box

Locate the first fuse box which is usually located on the driver’s side of the car under the hood.

It is usually black and clearly marked.

### Step 3: Secondary box

The second fuse box will be found under the dashboard below the steering wheel.

It may be hidden, but will be clearly marked.

Remove the cover and you will note that the fuses are smaller in this fuse box, compared to the one under the hood.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Occasionally this fuse box is located in the boot of the vehicle.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Fitting the tracker

<Steps>

### Step 1: Prep wires

Using wire cutters, strip a portion of each wire as required for proper and easy installation.

### Step 2: Access fuse box

Identify the location of the secondary fuse box, and open/remove the cover.

### Step 3: Identify the fuses

Connect one side of the tester to any metal part of the vehicle.

Check each fuse with the other side of the tester to locate a “direct” fuse and an “ignition” fuse.

If the tester shows current while the vehicle is turned off, it is a “direct” connection fuse.

If the tester shows current only when the vehicle is turned on, it is an “ignition” connection fuse.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Always try to use fuses with a low current - eg 5A, 7.5A, 10A, & 15A.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Connect to direct current

Remove the chosen “direct” fuse using the nose pliers.

Connect the red wire to one of the fuse legs.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iafp2W9.png)

Using the tester, test both pins from the fuse holder to identify which side has the current.

Return the fuse to the same slot ensuring that the leg with the red wire attached, is inserted to the side that holds no current.

### Step 5: Connect to ignition current

Remove the chosen “ignition” fuse using the nose pliers.

Connect the white wire to one of the fuse legs.

Using the tester, test both pins from the fuse holder to identify which side has the current when the ignition is on.

Return the fuse to the same slot ensuring that the leg with the white wire attached, is inserted to the side that holds no current when the ignition is on

### Step 6: Connect to earth

Connect the black wire to a metal part of the vehicle.

This can be done by removing a screw, placing the wire and screwing it back in.

### Step 7: Connect the tracker

The vehicle tracker can now be connected via the 3 pin Juliette connector.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Ensure you line up the markings so that the plug does not get damaged.
</Callout>

### Step 8: Check functionality

Before attaching the tracker and cables to the vehicle, ensure the device is in good working order.

Should the wiring be correctly fitted, the battery of the tracker will be charging and a blue light will be visibly glowing through the plastic.

You can also check the [vehicle connection status](http://localhost:8093/devices/vehicle#vehicle-connection-status) with a button press to make the other device LEDs light up.

### Step 8: Secure the tracker

If you are satisfied with the connections and that the tracker is behaving normally it's time to mount the tracker.

Fold and tie all the connecting cables neatly, using cable ties and insulation tape.

Locate a suitable place for mounting the tracker.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Always keep in mind that the device works optimally when mounted in such a way that it has clear visibility of the sky, without metal obstructions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Please be aware that some vehicles do have metal in the windscreen, this can obstruct the tracker.
</Callout>

Use cable ties to mount the tracker to the vehicle.

Ensure that the device and cables are firmly fastened to the vehicle and will not shake loose, and so that there are no irritating vibrations nor sound when the vehicle is moving.
