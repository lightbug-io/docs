# Modes

## Wake mode

More frequent updates, but more battery usage.

See the [update rate](devices/configuration/transmission#update-rate) device configuration.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your device battery level is critical, wake mode may be disabled.
  Generally this is 20% or less.
</Callout>

## Sleep mode

Will send updates based on the [beacon period](devices/configuration/transmission#beacon-period) set in device configuration.

If [motion detection](devices/configuration/motion) is enabled, the device may wake up and send more regular updates.
