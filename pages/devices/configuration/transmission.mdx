This setting only applies while the device is awake.

{/* TODO maximum number of points that can be sotred before sending? */}

## Enable power budget

Abandon Transmissions that are taking too much power, to preserve battery.

{/* stuff */}

## Transmit only on beacon

Collect data in wake mode, and limit transmission so that data is only uploaded every time a beacon is sent.

## Network wake delay

Delay transmission on first wake.

Useful to avoid approximate locations when the device first wakes up (waiting gives GPS chance to lock in).

Value is multiplied by 30s on the device side.

Value of 2 = 60s = 1 minute.

## Modem on when awake

{/*behaviour GsmOnWhenAwake*/}

Leave cellular modem on and connected when the device is awake.

Can improve performance in low signal areas.

## Modem on in sleep

{/*behaviour GsmOnWhenAsleep*/}

Leave cellular modem on and connected when the device is in power-saving mode.

Reduces time to first alert when device moves.

## Lock 2G mode

{/*modeControl2 Lock2G*/}

Force 2G mode and disable 4G network search.
Reduces search time in countries with no 4G LTE-M / CAT-M1 coverage (e.g. the UK) but may prevent roaming when abroad.

Only record points at the start and end of each trip to save power.

## Lock wake on Button

Lock wake mode when the button is pressed.

Designed for SOS type usage.
