# Motion detection

Choose how a device detects and handles various types of movement.

Ultimately, when motion detection is enabled, the device will wake up when moving and send beacons when stationary.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Battery life will be reduced when enabled.
</Callout>

## Sleep Sensitivity

{/*In the API this is debounce*/}

Movement sensitivity on a scale of 1 to 10 while the device is asleep.

It is correlated to the number of consecutive milliseconds the acceleration needs to exceed a threshold to count as movement and wake up.

| Sensitivity | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Very sensitive |
| 2 | Default |
| 4 | Reduced |
| 8 | Low |


## Wake Sensitivity

{/*In the API this is movementSensitivity2*/}

Movement sensitivity on a scale of 1 to 10 while the device is awake, to keep it awake.

Also called "Sensitivity after first move".

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This value should be lower or the same as the wake sensitivity.
</Callout>

## Stop timeout

Select how long (in seconds) the device should wait before entering sleep mode after motion stops.

Shorter timeout will capture more stops (for example when a vehicle stops at traffic lights).

Longer timeout may increase battery life.

## Detect shocks rather than falls
