# Motion detection

Choose weather the device should increase its reporting frequency when moving.

When motion detection is enabled, the device will automatically wake up when moving and send beacons when stationary.

  Battery life will be reduced when enabled.

## Sensitivity

The motion level required to keep the device awake once it is moving.

1 = most sensitive, 10 = least sensitive.

This value should be lower or the same as the wake sensitivity.
