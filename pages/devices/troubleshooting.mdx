# Troubleshooting

## Why are location updates not instant?

In most cases, location can not be retrieved instantly, it takes time to get a GPS fix and if that fails, the other location technologies come into action.

After a device has collected the location data, it has to connect to the internet via the mobile networks in order to send the location information.

Once the infomation has been recieved by our servers, during normal operation it should be visible to you within a few seconds.

## Why is my tracker not transmitting?

Always give your tracker a couple of minutes to send a location update.

If it still hasn't sent a location update, make sure:

- Your device has an active data plan
- Your device is charged
- The tracker is in an area with good mobile coverage

If you have checked the above and your tracker is still not transmitting, try the following:

- Force a location update (hold tracker button for 3 seconds)
- Perform a reset (hold tracker button for 15 seconds)
- Place the tracker outside for 5 minutes after completing all the above

If the tracker is still not transmitting, please contact us.

## Why is my tracker giving inaccurate locations?

Location accuracy depends on several variables.

There are a few good practices that help improve the location accuracy of your tracker.

- Try to place your tracker with the logo facing up (this is where the GPS antenna is located)
- Avoid surrounding your tracker with metals as they block GPS and GSM signals
- To allow for more GPS locations to be gathered, try to place your tracker somewhere with a good line of sight with the sky
- Increase the GPS timeout.
- Make sure you have the correct settings. If you are unsure, please get in touch and we will assist!

## Why is my battery not lasting as long as advertised?

The advertised values are general guidelines.

In reality, there are many variables that affect battery life, such as:

- Where the tracker is mounted: with a clear line of sight with the sky, the tracker will use less power per location update
- Is the tracker indoors? If the tracker is indoor, more power will be used as the tracker will try to look for a GPS fix before attempting to locate itself via WPS or GSM. Find out more about this under the How the location technologies work section
- Make sure you have Wi-Fi and GPS Safe Zones set up where applicable
- Motion sensitivity: maybe your tracker is sending more location updates than it should because the motion sensitivity is too high. This usually occurs when the tracker is stationary but still sending location updates. Reduce the motion sensitivity via your flexible configurations page.
