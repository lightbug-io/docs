# Troubleshooting

## Why are location updates not instant?

Generally, location updates are not instant as it takes time
to get a GPS fix and if that fails, the other location
technologies come into action. After the location data is
collected, the tracker has to connect to the internet via the
GSM network in order to send the location information.

## Why is my tracker not transmitting?

Always give your tracker a couple of minutes to send a
location update, and if that fails:

- Make sure you have an active data plan on your tracker
- Make sure your tracker is charged. Some battery drain might have occurred for a number of reasons
- Force a location update (hold tracker button for 3 seconds)
- Perform a reset (hold tracker button for 15 seconds)
- Ensure the tracker is in an area with good GSM coverage
- Place the tracker outside for 5 minutes after completing all the above

## Why is my tracker giving inaccurate locations?

Location accuracy depends on several variables. Please
refer to the How the Location Technologies Work section
for more details on how these technologies work.

There are a few good practices that help improve the
location accuracy of your tracker.

- Avoid surrounding your tracker with metals as they block GPS and GSM signals
- To allow for more GPS locations to occur, try to place your tracker somewhere with a good line of sight with the sky
- Try to place your tracker with the logo facing up
- Increase GPS timeout. Please refer to the manual configurations section and find out how to change the GPS settings
- Make sure you have the correct settings. You might need to tweak your advanced settings. If you are unsure, please get in touch and we will assist!

## Why is my battery not lasting as long as advertised?

The advertised values are general guidelines. In reality, there are many variables that affect battery life, such as:

- Where the tracker is mounted: with a clear line of sight with the sky, the tracker will use less power per location update
- Is the tracker indoors? If the tracker is indoor, more power will be used as the tracker will try to look for a GPS fix before attempting to locate itself via WPS or GSM. Find out more about this under the How the location technologies work section
- Make sure you have Wi-Fi and GPS Safe Zones set up where applicable
- Motion sensitivity: maybe your tracker is sending more location updates than it should because the motion sensitivity is too high. This usually occurs when the tracker is stationary but still sending location updates. Reduce the motion sensitivity via your flexible configurations page.
