# Firmware

Our firmware is entirely developed inhouse, and is deployed over the air (OTA) to all devices.
This allows us to quickly fix bugs, add new features, and adapt our devices to new requirements.

## Versioning

Firmware is versioned using incrementing build numbers.
Each build number is unique and corresponds to a specific build of the firmware, though builds may differ between devices.

- **nnn: 0 - 300**: Production firmware builds (before the introduction of release channels)
- **1nnn: 1000-1999**: Development firmware builds (historically where features were developed, before landing in a production build)
- **2nnn: 2000+**: Channel based firmware builds (see individual channels for specific build numbers)

### Channels

Channels are coming in 2024, and will provide a way to opt-in to a specific stability of firmware builds, or in advanced cases, to keep your device alligned with the latest development builds for certain features.

## Updates

Firmware updates are delivered over the air (OTA) to all devices.

Generally speaking, we will decide when to push an update to devices, and the devices will download and install the update automatically.

Resellers and Enterprise users with access to the [Admin app](/apps/admin) may individualy control some aspects of firmware updates, and choose specific channels (coming soon) or builds.
