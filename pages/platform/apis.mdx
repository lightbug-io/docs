# APIs

The platform is currently made up of 2 primary web APIs.

The [version 1](/apis/v1) API has been around since the first days of Lightbug. This API is stable and is used by the current platform, exposing all the functionality that is available to users.

The [version 2](/apis/v2) API is our new REST API (since 2023) that will see new interfaces to existing functionality, and new functionality being added.

Both APIs are accessible on the host `api.lightbug.cloud`, and you can find detailed OpenAPI documentation for each version on the respective pages linked above.
