# Overview

Devices collect data from both internal and external sources, such as [GPS](/platform/technology/gps), [WiFi](/platform/technology/wifi), [Bluetooth](/platform/technology/bluetooth), and other sensors.

This data is then processed and securely sent to the Lightbug platform via availible mobile networks.

The data is then processed and made availible to the user via [APIs](/apis), the [Lightbug app and web portals](/apps).

Users can make use of [notifications](/apps/cloud/account/notifications) to be alerted of specific events methods such as  [push notifications](apps/cloud/account/notifications#mobile-push), or [email](apps/cloud/account/notifications#email). Or to forward data to their own systems via [webhooks](apps/cloud/account/notifications#api-push).

For specific usecases, and for an [additional fee](silos#pricing), services for devices to talk to can be licenced and run on premisis as a [silo](/silos).
