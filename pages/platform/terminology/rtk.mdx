# RTK (Real-time kinematic positioning)

Some Lightbug devices include RTK (Real-time kinematic positioning) functionality.

This allows for more accurate positioning than GPS alone.

In summary:
 - A stationary base station is placed at a known location with precisely surveyed coordinates
 - The stationary device receives signals from satellites and calculates the difference between the observed and expected positions, sending these to backend servcies.
 - A mobile device receives realtime correction data from the stationary device, allowing it to calculate its position more accurately than GPS alone.
 - The mobile device sends its position to the backend services.
