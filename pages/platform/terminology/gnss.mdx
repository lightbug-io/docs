# GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)

GNSS location utilises 4 different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou) for the best accuracy.

It requires a direct line of sight with the sky to work (working best outdoors or near windows)

The accuracy is usually between 0.5 - 10 metres.
