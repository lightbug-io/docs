# Devices

Our current core devices are:
 - [Zero](/devices/zero): our smallest GPS tracking device, and indeed one of the smallest in the world.
 - [Pro](/devices/pro): our larger, industrial grade tracker.
 - [Vehicle](/devices/vehicle): our wired tracker, designed for use where a power source is available.
 - [Enviro](/devices/enviro): like a pro, but with high accuracy built-in sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity and absolute pressure

We also produce a number of custom devices for specific use cases that make use of the same platform.
