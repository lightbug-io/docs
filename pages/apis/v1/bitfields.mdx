# Bitfield helpers

The version 1 API exposes some rather low level settings and data from devices that may not be immediately obvious how to use or read.

These mainly take the form of boolean (true/false) flags that control device behaviour or report device state.

You can make use of the various helpers below to help you understand and use these values.

## Device Settings

### behaviour

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  DisableBluetooth & DisableWifi require a device reset to take effect.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="🧮">
  Use this calculator to determine the correct value to use for the `behaviour` settings.
  <Behaviour />
</Callout>

### modeControl

<Callout emoji="🧮">
  Use this calculator to determine the correct value to use for the `modeControl` settings.
  <ModeControl />
</Callout>

### modeControl2

<Callout emoji="🧮">
  Use this calculator to determine the correct value to use for the `modeControl2` settings.
  <ModeControl2 />
</Callout>

## Datapoint State

### sendReason

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Special case 255/0xFF: device was checking in with server. Ignore all data
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="🧮">
  Use this calculator to determine the correct value to use for the `sendReason` of datapoints.
  <SendReason />
</Callout>
