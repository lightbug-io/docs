# Overview

Lightbug devices communicate with our cloud using a proprietary low power encrypted protocol.

Typically, we will always recommend you allow us to manage this cloud resource but in some cases privacy or data sovereignty issues prevent this from being an option.

Silos enable enterprise users to run one or more components that make up our IoT platform within their own cloud or on their own hardware.

## Cost

Siloed listeners come at an additional cost either for self-managed, or fully managed deployments.

These rates can be found on [our main website](https://lightbug.io/product/custom/#data).

Silo licenses does not include [apps / user interfaces](/apps).

Normal per device usage fees still apply.
