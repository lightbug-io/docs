## Configuration mode

Select the configuration mode best suited to your needs.

 - **Easy mode**: designed to provide the most optimised settings for common use cases.
 - **Flexible mode**: designed to give you a little more control but is still easy to set up.
 - **Advanced mode**: - only recommended if you have spoken to our support team first, this exposes all low level device configuration settings.
