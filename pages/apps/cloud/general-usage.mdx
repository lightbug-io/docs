## Bluetooth Ranging

If you have paired the tracker to your smartphone, you will
also have the option to use the ranging feature.

This feature that helps you find your tracker if it has been
misplaced. When `Device is nearby` is displayed, you can press the `Range` button to use it.

The blue circle will fill up with colour as you get closer to
the tracker. We recommend slowly walking around and
using the blue circle to get a better idea of where the
tracker is.

Bluetooth cannot be used to reliably yield a direction. It
uses signal strength to determine if you are close or far from
the tracker.

The ranging functionality also displays additional tracker
information.

- `Device mode`: the motion status of the tracker. This will either show as ‘stationary’ or ‘moving’.
- `GPS Status`: whether the tracker is utilising GPS to determine the location. This will show as ‘off’, ‘searching’, ‘locked in’ or ‘no signal’.
- `Network status`: whether the tracker is communicating via GSM (2G or 4G). This will show as ‘off’, ‘searching’, ‘connected’ or ‘no signal.
