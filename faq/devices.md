## Can the devices be turned off?

There is no physical on/off button on any of our trackers, but you can disable the device through the [Lightbug App](/apps/cloud/).

If you no longer need the device, you can cancel your subscription at any time and reactivate devices at a later date.

There are other forms of control accessible via APIs, such as the ability to lock the device in sleep mode for up to 24 hours, which will temporarily disable location updates when moving. Or the ability to put a device in deep sleep, there is will need to be put on charge or button pressed to wake it up.

The battery life of the device depends on your required settings.

The best way to find out the estimated battery life is to use our [battery life calculator](https://lightbug.io/) on our website.

## Can the devices operate in extreme weather conditions?

Device operating temperature differs between different models and versions, so the device specification should be checked.
All current core devices operate between 0°C to 50°C, if you have other requirements this can be customized.
In both the extremely higher and lower temperatures the battery life of devices may be affected.

## Are the devices waterproof?

Check the device specifications on the [dedicated device pages](/devices) for the IP rating of the device.

## Does Lightbug install the devices?

No, we do not install devices.

Some devices, such as the vehicle tracker, have [dedicated installation guides](/devices/vehicle/installation).

Should you have any questions on installation and mounting, we're happy to help!

## Will the devices work straight out of the box?

The devices arrive **ready to use**, there is no assembly required; however, you will need to charge and activate your tracker.

You'll possibly find the [adding my first device guide](/guides/adding-your-first-device) useful if this is your first time using a Lightbug device.

## What comes in the box? ![](https://upload.r2.lb.chasm.cloud/2025/10/imgur/CaCDdWV.png){width=220 style="float:right"}

The contents of the box will vary depending on the device you have ordered.

The lightbug.io product listings include all information on what is bundled with the various SKUs.

Such as the page for the [Pro](https://lightbug.io/product/lb-dev-pr2/) which at the time of writing includes the Pro device, a charge dock, USB cable and one month of data.

## Are you able to produce custom devices?

Yes we can, we love being surprised by the new and innovative uses for our tracking technology!

So, if our devices don’t exactly fit your requirements, get in touch and we’ll see what we can do.

See [the custom devices page](/devices/custom) for more information.

## How often will I have to replace a Lightbug device?

Unless there is accidental damage, you should not need to replace your Lightbug GPS tracker.

If your device has a manufacturing defect within the first three years, it is likely covered under warranty, please [contact us](https://lightbug.io/contact/), as this differs per device and manufacture date.

## Where is the best place to mount devices?

It depends on your use case.

However, please do not fully surround the tracker with metal as it blocks the signals.

Below are some recommendations for best performance, if none of the suggestions work well for you, get in touch with details of your use case.

Some suggestions:
 - People: a bag, shoes, outside pocket, keys, lanyard
 - Assets: face the device upwards with a clear line of sight to the sky
 - Vehicle: glove compartment, under the seat, underside of the vehicle (magnetic LightBug Pro)

## Do the trackers need to be exposed?

Our trackers do not need to be fully exposed; however, they do not work well when fully surrounded by metal as this blocks the signals.

## How strong is the Pro magnetic mount?

The magnet is powerful with a pull force of 70lb / 32kg.

It will securely mount the Lightbug Pro to the underside of a moving vehicle.
