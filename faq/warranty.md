# How to maintain a healthy battery when storing/shelving trackers?

If you are planning on not using a tracker for a while, please ensure that you fully charge the tracker before deactivating it.

All our rechargeable trackers contain lithium ion batteries.

Storing depleted batteries causes their capacity to deteriorate and will void any warranty claims relating to low battery capacity arising from improper storage.
