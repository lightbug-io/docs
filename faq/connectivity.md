# Connectivity

[[toc]]

## Do the devices have Bluetooth connectivity?

Yes, at the time of writing all of our core devices have Bluetooth connectivity

This enables features like short range location searching, mobile safe-zone and remote controlled alarm to help you find it.

Be sure to check the [individual device pages](/devices) for the most up-to-date information.

## Do the devices need internet to work?

Each device works by sending information via the internet.
Our SIM cards can roam across many networks in different countries and will pick the network with the strongest signal, rather than being tied to a single operator.
Our devices do not work so well in remote areas with little/no cell coverage, as they need the internet to connect.

Unlike many GPS trackers, our devices have their own internet connection.

They do not rely on Bluetooth or being near a mobile phone.

## Will the devices work in remote/poor signal area?

Lightbug devices do not work so well in remote areas with little to no cell coverage, as they need the internet to connect.

Luckily, with over 600 network partners globally, this is a rare occurrence!

## Will the device work indoors?

Our trackers work both indoors and outdoors.

They use [GPS/GNSS](/terminology/positioning#gnss-global-navigation-satellite-system) to locate themselves outdoors and [WPS (WiFi Positioning System)](/terminology/positioning#wifi-positioning) when indoors.

Typical accuracy outdoors is 1-5m, and 10-30m indoors.

If you need better accuracy indoors, [get in touch](https://lightbug.io/contact/)!

## Which countries do LightBug products work in?

Lightbug devices feature [worldwide coverage](https://lightbug.io/feature/worldwide-coverage/).
