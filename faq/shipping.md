## Will I have to pay customs or import fees?

We will prepare all the required documentation for international shipping, however Lightbug does not take responsibility for any customs or import fees that may occur once your order reaches its destination country, the customer must cover these charges.

We have very little control over these charges, and cannot accurately tell you how much these would be as they vary widely from country to country.

If you have any queries regarding possible customs and fees, we recommend reaching out to your local customs office.
