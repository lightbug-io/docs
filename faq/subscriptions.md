# Subscriptions

[[toc]]

## Is there a subscription?

Yes.

For general customers, a device must be activated with card details added to the account to start a subscription.

For business customers, with many devices or custom requirements we can offer alternative billing methods.

## Can I use my own SIM Card and/or server?

Our core products are designed to work with our own SIM cards and servers, and are thus non-replaceable.

This is to ensure the best possible service and security for our customers.
All data transmitted by the devices is encrypted and needs to be processed on LightBug servers.
We do however provide an API for retrieving data and controlling devices.

Our SIM cards are global and do not need changing, a full list of countries is [available here](https://lightbug.io/feature/worldwide-coverage/).
If your country is not listed, please [contact us for a customised quote](https://lightbug.io/contact/).

If you still need to use your own SIM cards and have a requirement for 1000+ devices, [please get in touch](https://lightbug.io/contact/) regarding a custom device.

## Will it cost me extra to use my tracker in another country?

You don't have to worry about extra costs for using the device in any of the countries [listed here](https://lightbug.io/feature/worldwide-coverage/).

And, there are no permanent roaming restrictions either - you can use the devices where you want, for as long as you want.
