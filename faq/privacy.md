# Privacy

## What privacy measures are in place?

All data is encrypted in transit: from the moment a signal is transmitted by the device to the moment you view it.

We also adhere to all EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Your data cannot be viewed by anyone else and we will never look at your data (unless you ask us to for support).

Your data will never be sold or used for any purpose other than providing the service you signed up for.

Please [contact us](https://lightbug.io/contact/) if you have any questions about privacy.

## If someone finds the tracker can they trace it back to me?

If your tracker falls into the wrong hands there is no way they can find out who owns it.

Similarly there is no way they can re-purpose the tracker and use it for themselves or view historical data.

Please note that our devices are designed to allow you to track your own property and that in many countries it is illegal to track someone else or their property without explicit consent.

Please refer to local regulations before using LightBug devices.

We will co-operate with authorities and where illegal use has been identified, provide evidence which may be used for prosecution.
