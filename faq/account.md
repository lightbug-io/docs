## How can I add multiple Lightbug devices to my account?

There is no limit to the number of trackers you can have associated to a single account.

You can always add a new device in the Lightbug portal, on the [account page](https://lightbug.cloud/#/devices/settings/subscription) by [following the documented instructions](/apps/cloud/device-settings/subscription-account#add-a-new-device).

## Can multiple accounts track a single tracker?

It may be that you use your Lightbug GPS tracker for tracking a vehicle, and there are multiple users of the vehicle that all want to monitor it.

If you [contact us](https://lightbug.io/contact/) we can share trackers between accounts, so that multiple users can track the same device.

## Can I change the email address of my account?

If you need to change your email address after creating your Lightbug account, you need to [contact our support team](https://lightbug.io/contact/) and we will change it for you.

It is not possible for you to update this information on the any of our portals.
