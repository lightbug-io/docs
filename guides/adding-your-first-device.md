# Adding your first device

- **Target Audience**: First time users
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Prerequisites**: A Lightbug device that is not yet added to a Lightbug Cloud account.

## Guide

You first need to create a Lightbug Cloud account.

See [Creating an account](/apps/cloud/creating-account#registration) for step by step documentation.

On initial account creation, you will be guided through an onboarding process, where you will be prompted to add a first device.

See [Adding a device](/apps/cloud/creating-account#onboarding) for step by step documentation.

You'll then be shown a small guide of the Map and interface, as documented in [Interface guide](/apps/cloud/creating-account#interface-guide).

You are done! Your device is now added to your account and you can start tracking.
