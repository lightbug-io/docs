## Plan pool

All user accounts have a pool of plan credits.

When devices are activated, or when the monthly billing cycle occours, the device will consume plan credits from the pool.

If no credits are available of the required type, the plan will be purchased automatically, added to the pool, and then consumed by the device.

This pool is shared between all devices on the account.

### Bundled plans

Some products, such as retail bundles, come with one or more plan credits bundled with the product.

When an order is placed, the plan credits will be added to the pool of the user that placed the order.

If the order is not made via the shop, allocation of the plan credits will be done manually, and you may need to reach out to support to have the plan credits added to your account.

### Bulk purchasing

Plan credits can be purchased in bulk, at a discount on the [shop](https://lightbug.io/shop/).

Plans purchased this way will be added to the pool of the user that purchased the plans.

## Initial activation

When a device is activated, it will consume a plan credit from the pool, or you will be prompted to purchase a plan credit.

If the activation happens during the billing cycle, a full month's plan will be consumed, and you'll be credited for the remaining days of the month in your next invoice.

## Billing cycle

The billing cycle is fixed to the start of each month.

Any plans purchased mid month will be billed in full, and you will be credited for the remaining days in the next invoice.

## Plan changes

Upgrades and downgrades of plans can be done at any time.

If you upgrade a plan, you will be credited for the remaining days of the month of your previous plan in the next invoice, and a plan will be consumed from the pool for the new plan, or purchased.

If you downgrade a plan, a plan will be consumed from the pool for the new plan, or purchased.

If you cancel a plan, you will not be credited for the remaining days of the month.
