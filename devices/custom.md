# Custom

We know projects can be different and the requirements can be unique.

For this reason we offer a bespoke service where we can design and manufacture custom devices to meet your specific needs.

This could include bare PCBs, custom enclosures, custom firmware, sensors, RTK, LORA, or any other feature or specification that you might need.

For more information on custom devices, please see our [bespoke IoT product design](https://lightbug.io/product/custom/) page.
