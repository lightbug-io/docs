# Examples

The lightbug pkg comes with various examples touching on various levels of the device communication and capabilities.

These are found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/lightbug-io/toit-lightbug/tree/main/examples) of the pkg, which itself is a standalone Toit package.

More examples and guides will be included here over time, and if you need specific help, please reach out on Discord.
