# Applications

All of the [examples](../../examples/) in the lightbug pkg are applications.

However, some applications are more complex, and demo specific functionality, or real world use cases.

The first of these is the [Survey application](survey/), which was designed for the [RH2 device](/devices/rtk/handheld/), and showcases a complex Toit application, that interacts with the device hardware, hosts a local web app, forwards data to the cloud, and uses RTK GNSS corrections.
