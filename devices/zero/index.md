## LED Indicators

The small icons above each of the indicators show what information they display.

These indicators can light up while transmitting, or as the result of a button press.

## Charging

The Zero tracker is charged using a magnetic 4 pin connector, and should be charged for 3 hours before initial use.

This connecter can be used with a magnetic cable or a zero charging dock.
