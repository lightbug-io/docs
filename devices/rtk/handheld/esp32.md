# ESP32

The RH2 features a second co-processor, an [ESP32-C6](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6) from Espressif.

Out of the box, this processor simply provides the WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity of the RH2.

However custom applications can be developed for the ESP32, making use of the [high level Toit SDK](/devices/api/sdks/toit/) or [lower level messaging APIs](/devices/api/messages/) via anything else that can be flashed onto the ESP32.
