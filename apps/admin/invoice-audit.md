# Invoice Audit

::: warning
As of April 2025, all reseller devices have been moved onto the new billing system. As a result you may find the new [plans page](./plans) more useful for your needs when auditing an account for billing purposes.

Historically this invoice audit page was primarily for reseller plans and reseller billing.

It will likely be removed in the future.
:::

The invoice audit page allows you to see the number of devices activated and deactivated on your account in a given month.

You can also download a CSV export of the data.

The report will have the following headers:

```
BillableType,DeviceId,Serial,Name,ActivatedOn,DeactivatedOn,Plan
```
