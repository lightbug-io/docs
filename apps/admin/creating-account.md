# Creating an account

An account is needed to get started with the cloud platform and attached devices.

Lightbug accounts are shared across all Lightbug interfaces.

You'll need to create an account within the [cloud app](/apps/cloud/creating-account) to get started.

## Sub accounts

Once you have created an account, you can create sub accounts with access to your devices from the admin portal.

To find out how, see the section on [adding new users to devices](/apps/admin/devices#add-new-user).
