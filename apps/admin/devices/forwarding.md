# Manage Forwarding

Forwarding allows you to forward data from your devices to other services, currently webhooks and MQTT.

This will replace similar messaging based on Notifications, which is only accessible via API or the [Cloud app](/apps/cloud/account/notifications).

If you would like to use this feature, please contact support to get it enabled on your account, as it is not yet at General Availability.
