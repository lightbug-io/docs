# Manage Forwarding

:::tip Device compatibility
Forwarding is only available for devices that make use of the V3 protocol for messaging.
This currently includes the [RtkHandheld2](/devices/rtk/handheld/), [VehicleRtk](/devices/rtk/vehicle), Viper and ZCard devices.
:::

Forwarding allows you to forward data from your devices to other services, currently webhooks and MQTT.

This will replace similar messaging based on Notifications, which is only accessible via API or the [Cloud app](/apps/cloud/account/notifications).

If you would like to use this feature, please contact support to get it enabled on your account, as it is not yet at General Availability.
