# Manage RTK

RTK-specific controls are available for RTK-capable devices.

Open the RTK dialog from the device row actions to view and modify RTK settings by clicking the <i class="eva eva-star-outline" style="color: #fc7c3d; font-size: 1.5em;"></i>.

The settings can be used to configure both rover and base station modes.

## General

### Group

Selected by the user.
Any number 0 - 250.

All devices assigned the same group number will only connect to a Base unit with the same group number.
This prevents cross communication between groups.
This is useful when you have more than one group working close to each other.

Each group will be connected to their own Base unit.
Ensure each group is labelled with the corresponding number.

### NTRIP Settings

Input these configuration settings as per the supplier and setup.

This is compulsory for a high level of accuracy.

## Base mode

### Fixed Position

If you have known GPS coordinates select Fixed Position to green and input Altitude, and, Latitude & Longitude coordinates.
