# Admin

The admin portal allows bulk management of devices, and sub accounts.

Most interfaces come in the form of tables, with bulk selections to speed up various actions.

The Lightbug Admin Portal is available on the web only.

If you only manage a few devices, or want a prettier experience, you should take a look at the [cloud portal](/apps/cloud/).
