# Linking your first tracker

After [creating a new account](creating-account), the Lightbug App or the web
portal will guide you through the simple steps to link your
tracker to your account.

### Step 1: Entering Serial Numbers

The serial number appears on a sticker on all Lightbug devices.

Enter the serial number and click **Register**.

::: tip ℹ️ Info
Hint: If you have Bluetooth enabled while using the Lightbug App, it will automatically detect the device serial number and fill it in for you.

### Step 2: Setting up your Data Plan

Choose a plan for your device, by clicking the **Select** button on a plan.

If needed, you can change your plan later on.

**Per Location Billing**

TODO pay per location no longer exists

Every time a device transmits (e.g. updates its position), a location counter is incremented for your account.
If you have multiple devices, they all add to your counter.
At the end of each month, you will receive a bill for your total usage.

::: tip ℹ️ Info
Usage per device per month is capped to 300 updates to make sure your bill stays small.
There is also a minimum charge of 10 locations per bill to cover credit card processing fees.
:::

More information covering pay per location billing [can be found on our main website](https://lightbug.io/data-fees/).

**Standard Plan**

The Standard plan offers up to 6 location updates per day
with a fixed monthly fee.

::: warning ⚠️ Warning
The standard plan is not compatible with our motion detection feature.
:::

**Unlimited Plan**

If you anticipate that the device will transmit very often, it
may be more cost effective to select the Unlimited Plan.
You will be billed the stated price, no matter how many
times the device transmits its location.

### Step 3: Adding billing information

TODO update writing on free trials

Add your billing information so that your tracker will remain active after your free trial period.

You will not be charged until your free trial period is over.

::: tip ℹ️ Info
Current free trial periods are 300 free location credits, or 1 month of the Standard or Unlimited plan.

::: warning ⚠️ Warnig
Your Lightbug tracker will not activate if you do not add your billing information.
