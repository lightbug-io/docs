If you have no billing details set up, you will be prompted to enter them before the device will then be activated and the plan consumed.

## Purchased Plans

The Purchased Plans section will show you the plans you have purchased, that are in your [plan pool](/terminology/billing#plan-pool) and, that are currently unused.

If you have no pre purchased plans, you will see a message indicating that you have no plans.
