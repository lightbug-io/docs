Upon opening the `Settings` tab, you will be presented with the main device settings page, for all currently selected devices.

You can select other parts of the device settings by clicking on the tabs on the left side of the page.

## Single selection

If you only have one device, you'll see the name in the top left corner of the page showing a single device is selected.
