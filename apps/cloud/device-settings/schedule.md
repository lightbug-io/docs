# Schedule

Schedule is a feature that allows you to configure device behaviour based on time of day and day of week.

Typical use cases include triggering a location update at specific times, disabling motion detection during off hours, or locking the device in wake mode during work hours.

## Triggers

You can choose any individual day of the week, or `Every day`.

A time in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) can also be selected.

## Actions
