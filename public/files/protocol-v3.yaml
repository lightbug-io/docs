          If no interval is provided, messages will be sent as and when new data is available.
          Some data, such as GPS position, may require a set interval to be provided.

      If no interval is provided, messages will be sent as and when new data is available.
      Some data, such as GPS position, may require a set interval to be provided.
      If the interval is less than the period required to acquire the data, or refresh the data, the data may be send less often than requested.

    name: Duration
    description: |
      To be used with the SUBSCRIBE method, or actions that can be timed.

      When used with a timed action:
        This defines how long the action should go on for.

      When used with the SUBSCRIBE method:
        This defines a duration to keep the subscription active for.
        A value of 0 means the subscription is indefinite until explicitly unsubscribed.
        An ACK with EXPIRED status code will be sent if the subscription duration elapses without being renewed with a new subscription request.

  8:
    name: Timeout
    description: |
      When requesting data or services that can take time to acquire (such as a GPS fix), this defines how long to try for before abandoning the action.
      An ACK with ABANDONED status code will be sent in this case.
      For actions that support it, timeout instead defines how long to wait before performing the action.

      When used with a SUBSCRIBE method, with a Message Level header field:
      This defines the time to wait for a message of the given level, before cancelling the subscription.
      Example: GPS subscribe with Message Level 'Valid' and Timeout 60000ms

    name: Storage Level
    description: |
      Defines the behaviour for messages that have not been ACKed.
      The default is None, i.e. failed messages will not be retried.
      Devices have limited storage, if using retries and when storage is full, the oldest messages will be overwritten.
      Future iterations may support "In Order" which will require messages to be sent and ACKed in timestamp order.

    name: Message Level
    description: |
      Loosely analogous to log levels (trace, debug, info, warning, etc.) in that you must define the lowest level of interest.
      Message Levels can be used with timeouts on subscriptions - if a message of the requested level is not available within the specified time,
      the subscription will be abandoned.
      Currently you may only define one subscription per message type - requesting multiple levels will result in existing subscriptions being modified to the new level.
      Future iterations will support "Changes Only" and "Critical" and may support multiple concurrent subscriptions with varying levels

    name: Subscription ID
    description: |
      ID of the subscription being managed, when multiple subscriptions are being used per message type (advanced usage).
      If not provided, Subscription ID 0 is assumed (the default subscription).

      Can be used to uniquely identify subscriptions when multiple subscriptions of the same message type exist.
      Devices may have default subscriptions, and these will use Subscription ID 0.
      So SUBSCRIBing without a Subscription ID, or with subscription ID 0 will, create or modify the default subscription.

      When using with the SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE methods, you should optionally provide a single uint8 value.

      If messages are sent as part of a non 0 Subscription ID,
      one or more Subscription IDs will be included in the message header to identify which subscription(s) the message relates to.

    name: ACK
    description: |
      Used to acknowledge a previously sent message.

      Empty ACKs are useless and should not be sent.
      Either the Response Message ID field, or the ACK Type field should be populated.
      Multiple fields can be populated if desired.
      The Header status field can be used to indicate OK, or an error condition.

      In the case that a response is being sent immediately, an ACK is not required.
      But the response should contain the Response Message ID header field.

      If a sender does not receive an ACK or response, it may resend the message.

      ACKs should not themselves be ACKed.
