      To be used with the SUBSCRIBE method, or actions that can be timed.

      When used with a timed action:
        This defines how long the action should go on for.

      When used with the SUBSCRIBE method:
        This defines a duration to keep the subscription active for.
        A value of 0 means the subscription is indefinite until explicitly unsubscribed.
        An ACK with EXPIRED status code will be sent if the subscription duration elapses without being renewed with a new subscription request.

    name: Timeout
    description: |
      When requesting data or services that can take time to acquire (such as a GPS fix), this defines how long to try for before abandoning the action.
      An ACK with ABANDONED status code will be sent in this case.
      For actions that support it, timeout instead defines how long to wait before performing the action.

    description: |
      Defines the behaviour for messages that have not been ACKed.
      The default is None, i.e. failed messages will not be retried.
      Devices have limited storage, if using retries and when storage is full, the oldest messages will be overwritten.
      Future iterations may support "In Order" which will require messages to be sent and ACKed in timestamp order.

    name: Message Level
    description: |
      Loosely analogous to log levels (trace, debug, info, warning, etc.) in that you must define the lowest level of interest.
      Message Levels can be used with timeouts on subscriptions - if a message of the requested level is not available within the specified time,
      the subscription will be abandoned.
      Currently you may only define one subscription per message type - requesting multiple levels will result in existing subscriptions being modified to the new level.
      Future iterations will support "Changes Only" and "Critical" and may support multiple concurrent subscriptions with varying levels

    description: |
      Used to acknowledge a previously sent message.

      Empty ACKs are useless and should not be sent.
      Either the Response Message ID field, or the ACK Type field should be populated.
      Multiple fields can be populated if desired.
      The Header status field can be used to indicate OK, or an error condition.

      In the case that a response is being sent immediately, an ACK is not required.
      But the response should contain the Response Message ID header field.

      If a sender does not receive an ACK or response, it may resend the message.

      ACKs should not themselves be ACKed.
